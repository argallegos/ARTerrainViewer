# ARTerrainViewer

This project is a prototype designed to allow the user to view terrain data in AR. 
It uses Unity with ARFoundation and ARCore. It is designed for Android devices with AR capability, and currently only supports a vertical phone orientation. 

User can place the model on a detected surface, then explore the terrain by spinning it, scaling it, changing its location, and physically moving around it. Additionally, users can view points of interest by toggling on a button.
